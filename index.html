                    I knew what it was like to be strong healthy and happy, soon that would be taken away from me. This
                    was me when I was in the best form in my life, where I became one of the fastest 800m runners in
                    New Zealand. Two months later I would be diagnosed with leukaemia and running a different race. A
                    race for my life.

                    The aftermath of chemo and radiation. How much my body changed from the above photo. I became lost,
                    confused, angry, frustrated and deeply depressed. I thought life had been taken away from me,
                    though life hadn’t been taken away I was just living life differently than what I presumed it would
                    be. I was only starting to live fully.

                    I spent ten days on life support, there was a big question mark weather I would wake from the coma
                    or not. Fortunately I did. im sure my running background helped me through this difficult time for
                    me and my family.

                    Another dream came true after my first diagnosis, it was tough going to make it to Everest
                    basecamp, but with a will and a way I preserved through the ‘good pain’ as I knew what real pain
                    felt like. An incredible achievement after being diagnosed with leukemia the year prior.
